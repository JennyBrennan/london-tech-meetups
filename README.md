# london-tech-meetups

A list of London tech meetups, focusing on meetups suitable for beginner coders, as well as women-majority events. It started as a list sent to classes at the end of my [Code First: Girls](http://codefirstgirls.org.uk "Code First Girls courses for women") courses. I'm super open to suggestions - it's unlikely to be comprehensive (particularly in the language/framework-specific parts), but is hopefully a good start. You can find it at [http://jennybrennan.com/london-tech-meetups](http://jennybrennan.com/london-tech-meetups "List of London tech meetups beginner friendly and women majority")
