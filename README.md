# london-tech-meetups

A list of London tech meetups, focusing on meetups suitable for beginner coders, as well as women-majority events. It started as a list sent to classes at the end of my <a href="http://codefirstgirls.org.uk">Code First: Girls</a> courses. I'm super open to suggestions - it's unlikely to be comprehensive (particularly in the language/framework-specific parts), but is hopefully a good start.

### How to contribute

4. Make your change (the list is in index.html, please include the link and description text)
5. Go to your branch in your repository on GitHub, and click the green 'New pull request' button on the left
