    <h2>About this list</h2>
    <p>This list was originally put together by <a href="http://jennybrennan.com">Jenny Brennan</a> and is open to contributions (see below).
    <p>The focus is on meetups suitable for beginners, as well as women-majority events, as it started from lists sent to classes at the end of my <a href="http://codefirstgirls.org.uk">Code First: Girls</a> courses.
    <p>It's up to date as of May 2016.
